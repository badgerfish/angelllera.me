<a id="welcome-to-my-site" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-my-site" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>This is me</h3>

<p>Hi, I'm Angel R. Llera. I'm a professional consultant with 3 years of experience in app and website design, a passionate wargamer and miniature painter, and a fan of video games and digital art. I'm a computer engineer with an emphasis on computing systems and software design. I'm from Puerto Rico, and studied at the University of Puerto Rico, Mayaguez Campus.</p>
<p>You're probably wondering why this site is so simple if I'm a site designer. Well there's very good reasons for that. Firstly, cost, it's free, there's not a lot that's better than free. And Secondly, It's easy to set up and doesn't take much time to maintain, which means I have more time to work on more fun things.</p>

<a id="skillz" class="anchor" href="#skillz" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How I pay the bills</h3>

<p>By day I'm a programmer, currently I'm unemployed, but I keep busy working on small projects like making video games, and websites like this one. I'm versed in Javascript using primarily jQuery, and CSS dances to my keyboard kicks. As part of my education as a computer engineer I was trained to use Java, and while I can use it fairly well, I preffer C#, though I don't have a particular reason for this other than using it a lot on Unity. I know Unity, I use it on al almost daily basis to work on tutorials, small games, and my hobby projects. To create assets for Unity I use Blender, which is particularly user un-friendly. I'm learning Maya, but I've yet to dedicate it much time, however I've used AutoCAD before and it was easy and fun (for me) to get into. I know my away around PHP fairly well, and have worked on the back-end design and programming of a couple of websites like scholar-link.com. I also know SQL, and have experience desingning, streamlining and implementing Databases in mySQL (which I don't really care how you pronounce as long as we're talking about the same thing). Also I've worked with mongodb, and like it, though the long term usage of it might not be recommended for big projects. I also have a couple of years of retail management experience from when I was working at an electronic's store. That kind of experience gave me a really good handle on things like small scale advertising, personel and schedule management, and even some people skills.</p>

<h3>
<a id="werk-ethic" class="anchor" href="#werk-ethic" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How I work</h3>

<p>I have a very strong work ethic. I don't believe in clocking-out and leaving a task for the next day (unless it's absolutely necessary). Because of this I have a tendency to overwork a bit. At the same time I consider myself an aggressive generalist, meaning I can speak about any given subject in detail for about 10 minutes, and before you think that that doesn't seem like very much, try giving your opinion on contrastive focus reduplication without googling what it is. Sure I know programming and a couple of languages, but I also apply my knowledge of design, philosophy, ethics, logic, and even gaming to solve problems, which makes me slightly more interesting than that person sitting next to you, unless they funnier than me, which is unlikely. When I encounter a problem my first move is to try and understand what caused it, most of the time standard fixes aren't enough, whenever possible I like to fix and prevent problems, bugs, errors, and other obstacles; but more importantly I have a desite to understand why the happened in the first place. Sometimes I don't get along with other people, this is because other people sometimes make me anxious, specially in large groups. I get overwhelmed easily, specially if given a task with exceptionally loose tolerances, or lacking specific goals and requirements.</p>

<h3>
<a id="hobbies" class="anchor" href="#hobbies" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How I spend my time off</h3>

<p>I like tabletop games. Particularly wargames, like Warhammer 40k and Infinity. Games like these are my passion. Given time and money I would likely open a game store to feature these kinds of games and grow a healthly friendly player base. When I'm not building miniatures, customizing them, painting them to a high standard or playing with my toy soldiers I'm likely playing or making video games. I'm a big fan of RPGs, strategy games, and some shooters. When not doing that I'm probably sleeping or finding a place to eat something exciting and delicious. I'm a fairly adventurous person and also love to travel whenever possible. Though I'm also 6'2" which means that flying places can be a literal pain, depending on the airline.</p>

<h3>
<a id="other-stuff" class="anchor" href="#other-stuff" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How I... [insert something clever and relevant]</h3>

<p>I'm a curious person, I will ask questions. If you don't ask about me, I will likely not say anything. I don't like to talk about myself unless asked. So why all this talk about me on the site? It's so you know, and if you still find I haven't answered your question you can email me at: angel.llera@upr.edu OR sneakybadger88@gmail.com and I'll get back to you with one.</p>
